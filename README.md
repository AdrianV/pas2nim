pas2nim
=======

pas2nim is a tool to translate Delphi/Pascal wrappers to Nimrod code.

It was used to translate the original Nimrod compiler that was written in Pascal. Only what maps easily to Nimrod is supported. Delphi's ``class`` or other "fancy" features are not supported. 

**Note**: This project is essentially not maintained anymore! Help if you are interested in keeping it alive!
