pas2nim
=======

pas2nim is a tool to translate Delphi/Pascal wrappers to Nim code.

It was used to translate the original Nim compiler that was written in Pascal.
Only what maps easily to Nim is supported. Delphi's ``class`` or other "fancy"
features are not supported.

**Note**: This project is essentially not maintained anymore! Help if you are
interested in keeping it alive!
